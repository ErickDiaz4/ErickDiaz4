Hi everyone, in this paragraph I'm going to talk a bit about myself. I'm a systems technician and through that process, I've been able to delve into programming, which I absolutely love. I started studying programming a year ago at an academy called Digital House. During this time, I've learned about **HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. I've also learned about MySQL and agile methodologies, as well as the best way to work in a team**.

At this moment, I've just started with Backend. I'm studying **Java and UX/UI**. I still have a lot to learn in this world.

Here you'll find some projects that I'm working on...
